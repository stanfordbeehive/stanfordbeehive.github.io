# Writing an introduction

The purpose of the introduction is to motivate the work, describe why solving
a particular problem is important in the larger context, describe difficulties in
solving this problem, and describe related approaches that have come before
this work. The introduction section often concludes with a paragraph giving a
rough outline of the paper (this is almost mandatory in some types of journals,
e.g., JMLR, JASA, AOAS).

One common mistake with Introductions sections: No results or conclusions
should be included. We are setting the stage, making the relevance of the
results clear in the larger context, but not giving away the punchline.

## Tips for writing the introduction

Before writing the introduction, think hard about the general ideas that are
necessary for this paper to be relevant. Each paragraph should cover one of
those ideas. E.g.,

1. What is a BLURG?
2. Why is a BLURG important biologically?
3. How do we experimentally assay BLURGs? What are their limitations?
4. What types of methods exist to statistically predict BLURGs? What are their limitations?
5. What is the basic experimental design of this paper? why is this different than previous work?
6. How is this paper laid out?

The introduction is also the place to define all of the concepts used in the
paper. All acronyms to domain-specific ideas should be defined here (e.g., SNPs,
TFBSs, DHSs).

## Introduction writing

The introduction should contain short, easy to read sentences. (Nearly) everything that is mentioned about definition, context, and existing approaches
should be supported by citations.

- Mendeley: Fancier way to organize and gather bibliographies. Drop PDFs
into the interface and it pulls the reference. Export collection of papers
to .bib file. Free (up to a point!) and on the web.
- Google Scholar: surprisingly easy to pull BibTex reference to all papers
and books (find paper, hit ‘cite’, hit ‘Export to BibTex’)
