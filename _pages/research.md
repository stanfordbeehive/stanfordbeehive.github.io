The BEEHIVE develops tailored models and methods using approaches from statistics and machine learning in order to study, deconstruct, visualize, predict, modify, and engineer biomedical systems. 

## Genomics
Measurements of biological systems have both noise and systematic bias, and often the analytical goal is to identify biologically-meaningful low-dimensional substructure within a high-dimensional space with structured samples, such as time-series data, single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics samples, or Perturb-seq CRISPR screens. We build model-based approaches to gain access to interesting biological phenomena that would be otherwise missed.

## Electronic healthcare data
Electronic healthcare records (EHRs) hold the promise of studying the processes of hospital patient care, and automating and improving this care using machine learning approaches. Our group has worked on time-series models of EHR data, off-policy reinforcement learning methods to capture these data, and a number of applications of these approaches to patient scenarios, including ventilator weening, electrolyte repletion, and administration of lab tests.
