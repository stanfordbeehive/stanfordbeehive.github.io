The BEEHIVE develops innovative statistical models and methods in order to study, predict, and modify biomedical systems. 

## Genomics
elucidate biological mechanisms of complex phenotypes and disease. Measurements of biological systems have both noise and systematic bias, and often the analytical goal is to identify low-dimensional substructure within a high-dimensional space. These qualities are well-addressed by model-based analyses. But the high dimension and scale of biological data makes parameter estimation in sophisticated models challenging. We address these challenges by developing hierarchical statistical models and approximate parameter estimation methods to gain access to interesting biological phenomena.
