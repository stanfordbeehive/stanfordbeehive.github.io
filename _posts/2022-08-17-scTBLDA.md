title:  "Single-cell telescoping bimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (scTBLDA)"
---

BEEHIVE alumna Dr. Ari Gewirtz and @will_townes post preprint [Expression QTLs in single-cell data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.14.503915v1.abstract) that describes single-cell telescoping bimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (scTBLDA) applied to population-scale single-cell RNA-seq data to find expression QTLs.

These beautiful [scRNA-seq and paired genotype data](www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abf1970) come from Jimmie Yee's Lab and include approximately 400,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 119 women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

We extend our method, [telescoping bimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (TBLDA)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35977827/), that identifies covarying genotypes and gene expression values when the matching from samples to cells is not one-to-one in order to allow cell-type label agnostic discovery of eQTLs in noncomposite scRNA-seq data. In particular, we add GPU-compatibility, sparse priors, and amortization to enable fast inference on large-scale scRNA-seq data.

We find complex cell-type heterogeneity within specific immune cell-type labels.

We use linked genes and SNPs to identify 205 cis-eQTLS, 66 trans-eQTLs, and 53 cell type proportion QTLs. Our results demonstrate the ability of scTBLDA to identify genes involved in cell-type specific regulatory processes associated with SNPs in single-cell data.
 
We found broad replication of our findings in three scRNA-seq studies:

We found enrichment of our trans-eQTLs in enhancers using stratified LD score regression.

scTBLDA is an important step forward in methods for eQTL analysis in single-cell sequencing studies. Our approach shifts the paradigm of mapping QTLs from univariate analyses to an analysis that more accurately captures statistical complexities and biological models of regulation.
